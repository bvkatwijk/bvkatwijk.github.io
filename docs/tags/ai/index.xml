      <description>&lt;p&gt;Generative models (colloquially: AI) are here and they will never leave again. The quality of generated material, especially text, has improved enough that has become hard to tell if it was (partially) generated by AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since no rule exists mandating an indication what content is AI-generated, we are faced with choosing between not caring if something was artificially generated, assuming everything is AI-generated, or becoming experts at differentiating between AI and human made content, a battle which AI will likely win.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
