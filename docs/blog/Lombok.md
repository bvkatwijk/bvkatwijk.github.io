One of my favourite tools in the Java ecosystem is [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/). It reduces the code you have to write, and increases the correctness of your code.

These days I usually include this `lombok.config` [configuration file](https://projectlombok.org/features/configuration) in the root of my projects:

```config
config.stopBubbling = true
lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true
lombok.fieldDefaults.defaultPrivate = true
lombok.fieldDefaults.defaultFinal = true
lombok.accessors.chain = true
lombok.accessors.fluent = true
```
### Configuration

When I use setters, I prefer to return the instance I'm working on to be able to chain a lot of calls together. This is set as the default using `lombok.accessors.chain = true`.

I've never been too fond of having to prefix getters with `get`, so by setting `lombok.accessors.fluent = true` I can omit that everywhere.

> [!WARNING]
> The [Accessors](https://projectlombok.org/features/experimental/Accessors) features are `experimental`, and may change in the future.

Now that our accessor methods are very smooth we will rarely need field access so we can set `lombok.fieldDefaults.defaultPrivate = true` to make everything private unless specified otherwise.

I prefer immutability in my projects, so setting `lombok.fieldDefaults.defaultFinal = true` sets this as the default, making me do extra work when I have to make fields mutable, and saves a lot of `final` keywords.

Setting `lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true` helps with some tools that inspect code to indicate that this is generated code.

Lombok can `bubble up` when searching for configuration. This means that it will traverse up the directories and use the configuration file(s) that it can find. Setting `config.stopBubbling = true` tells Lombok to stop looking for more files.

### IDE Generation

Code generated by Lombok can also be generated using your IDE. However, an important difference is that code generated by Lombok will keep evolving.

For example, a `@Getter` on your type will evolve with your type, meaning that when you add or remove fields, it will also add or remove the `get` methods, which is not the case when you would have generated them using your IDE. This makes code evolution easier.

The same holds for `@EqualsAndHashCode`. Bugs involving equality can be hard to track down. This can happen when an `equals` method was not kept up-to-date with changes to fields, or was not aligned with the corresponding `hashcode` method. Using the Lombok annotation not only makes these bugs impossible but also hides all the implementation details away.

### Opinionated

The Lombok library steers you towards a style of programming favouring (among other things) type safe code and immutability. This not only aligns with features from languages like Kotlin and Scala 

Java 14 introduced `record` classes, meaning that we can frequently replace the classes that we would have set up using `@Value`. For me this highlights the purpose that Lombok fulfils in the Java landscape.
