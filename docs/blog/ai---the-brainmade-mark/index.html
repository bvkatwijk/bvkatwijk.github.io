The quality of generated material, especially text, has improved enough that has become hard to tell if it was (partially) generated by AI.</p>
<p>Since no rule exists mandating an indication what content is AI-generated, we are faced with choosing between not caring if something was artificially generated, assuming everything is AI-generated, or becoming experts at differentiating between AI and human made content, a battle which AI will likely win.</p>
<p>Personally when I read an article and I discover halfway through that I am reading (mostly) AI content I cannot help but feel a sense of disappointment or dishonesty. I assume I am reading someones opinion, their expertise, or their experience.</p>
<p>For me it&rsquo;s not that AI is not useful - it obviously is - but it is my assumption of experiencing content made and endorsed by a real human. The content generated using this impressive technology has entered public discourse and is rapidly taking it over.</p>
<p>Currently (2024) it&rsquo;s still doable to confidently identify many posts as being AI-generated, but the opposite is not true. I have no way of knowing that a piece of information is actual human-made content or that the generative model used is just one that has become good enough to fool me.</p>
<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate">Tris Oaten at NoBoilerplate</a> created a video  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kul0z3OTmVM">The &ldquo;BrainMade&rdquo; mark</a> where he explains his initiative of including a logo, <a href="https://brainmade.org/">BrainMade</a> - indicating what you are looking at is content of a real human being. I like this - it is an explicit statement that what you are looking at is created by someone real. With intent, effort and passion.</p>
<p>I use AI here and there - for example, finding a few ways to phrase something differently. But everything on this site is me, my opinions, my experience. My goal is to have a place to show who I am, and AI is (and will not be) a part of that.</p>
